# 🧠 ReciteEasily
**Concept:** ReciteEasily is a program allowing you to convert a revision sheet written from a precise OpenOffice document template into a quiz to test yourself.

## 📜 Context
**This software has an important backstory!** I coded it when I was very young, and I haven't made any changes to it since then. Because of this:

- It might not be compatible with the latest versions of Minecraft.
- There could be errors or glitches.
- The code might not be the best or the most efficient (little me has never taken a programming course).

I decided to release this software as a part of a series on my YouTube channel [Aywen](https://www.youtube.com/@aywenvideos). In the series, I explore and test the programs I coded during my childhood. The decision to release some of these programs is to give my community the chance to improve them and make them functional.

If there are promising or functional versions of my software developed by the community, I'll be showcasing them in a video on my channel! 📽️

## ⚙️ Instructions
1. In this software, you must use a revision sheet which has been established from a specific OpenOffice template. In the "Template OpenOffice" folder at the root you will find:
- Template.ott which is the blank template to use
- Example of sheet.odt which is an example of a sheet

To use this template, you must use [Open Office Styles and Formatting](https://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/FR/Documentation/Writer_Guide/Styliste#:~:text=Pour%20ouvrir%20la%20fen%C3%AAtre%20Styles,S%C3%A9lectionnez%20Format%20%3E%20Styles%20et%20formatage.).

2. Then, when your course is written, it is necessary to export this file in .html format from the Open Office interface.

3. Finally, you can import the .html file from the software interface.
